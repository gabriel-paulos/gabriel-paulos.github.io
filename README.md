# my personal webpage

Just my webpage with some inspo from the [`hugo-researcher`][1] theme 

To dos:
 - [x] Automate deployment via aws-cli
 - [x] Maybe also use aws-cli to update (invalidate) CloudFront distribution
 - [ ] Move deployment to free-tier cloudfare
 - [ ] change `processing.html` to do different stuff based on user input/location/timestamp
