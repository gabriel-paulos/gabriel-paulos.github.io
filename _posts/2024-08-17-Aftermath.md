Recently, I had my heart broken.

It sucked, but that's not the point. While enduring the post-breakup blues, I felt very alone, but by all interpretations, I wasn't. I consider myself beyond lucky to have as many good friends as I do. But you'd have no reason to grieve in the first place if your problems could be solved just by swapping people out. Machines replace damaged parts; humans heal them.

So here are some things I've picked up on recently.

#1

You drive, the radio plays, and vulgar, brilliant pop music streams from your stereo. Swift belts out lyrics about connection, love, heartache. Lyrics you thought immature, beneath you suddenly swell and resonate within you like they were written in your soul[^1]. Your eyes sting, and you smile, and you pretend the smile spreading across your face and tears pooling, blurring your view are ironic somehow. Not much ever is. You wonder how you were ever conceited enough to believe that these feelings were just yours. And the drums build, and her voice soars. And you feel a little less alone.

#2

You capture a fragment of a conversation, rushing past strangers, as strangers rush past you.

"I don't know if I'll ever be able to get over him."

You continue but your mind balks. Frames of a life every bit as vivid as yours are thrown through your head. You want to turn around, stop her. Ask her the questions you've asked yourself, and see if her answers make as little sense as yours do. You continue, and the distance grows.

But you're somewhere else now. As you flow through the blurred greys of the damp city, as you glide through unfamiliar crowds. You think it might be the rain, but every face you glance at reflects your own. The distance shrinks. And you realise that the life of every stranger has been lived by all strangers. And you feel a little less alone.

You're never truly alone, and you're reminded of this constantly. We understand each other more than we'll ever know.

Until next time,
