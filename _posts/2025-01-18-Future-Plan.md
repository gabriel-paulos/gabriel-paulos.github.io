hello!

This blog is to help me stay accountable to learning and hopefully provide value to others!

In terms of what I will post: content related to my personal projects, educational content.

I will be soon starting on writing: hallucinations of VLMs, then write about my MCTS and DPO project.

Timeline? I will be trying to build everything live, as in I will publish as I go. Ideas are living things
that live in their society. I hope to inspire others to view it similarly through my posts. Each blog post will be denoted by a tag as explained below:

lifecycle tag  | Stage Explanation 
----|--------
numen | These posts are meta beings that hold powers over this society of ideas
embryo  | This is the conception and commitment to the idea; I am yet to even research it.  
baby   | I am gathering research and have a sense of the structure of the post.
child | I am done gathering enough information that I could flesh out a story arc for the post
adolescent | Its hit puberty... not once... not twice... maybe three times? Or maybe more! Here the post may experience many changes that could drastically change the arc of the post. It might get a little antsy, but don't worry this stage hopefully does not take too long.
adult | It's done and requires minor changes.
death | The idea has become outdated and surpassed by a newer one! Tragic, however if this happens I will link this post to the newer one. The hope is that keeping it up and not deleting it will show a 'chain-of-thought' (yes, that is now part of my vernacular) that can be helpful to show how an intergenerational evolution of these ideas (keeping with the proposition that ideas live in their own society) and demonstrate that no one is always right, and that's okay!
