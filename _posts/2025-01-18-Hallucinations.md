Motivating Question: Why do VLMs hallucinate? Why do they hallucinate **_more than_** LLMs? Can we do anything about it?

Partial Inspiration: [paper](ttps://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/)

Agenda:

What are VLMs?

How are they trained?

What are hallucinations? Are VLMs more hallucination prone that LLMs? Why or why not?

Taxonomy of VLM hallucinations?

Current Hallucination Mitigation methods for VLMs?
