## About Me 

{{< headshot src="/avatar.jpg" name="" add="" >}}

I am an incoming doctoral student at [Stanford Earth][5] ESS Department. In the
past, I was a pre-doctoral fellow at the Energy Policy Institute (EPIC) at the
University of Chicago, working at the [Climate Impact Lab][3] and with Professor
Steve Cicala. In a past life, I was a Data Scientist at [DSaPP][4] (now at
Carnegie Mellon), and a career bureaucrat at the Central Bank of Colombia. 

## Research Interests

My interests are environmental and energy economics. I would like to explore the
political constraints of environmental regulation, and the interplay of human
and earth systems by using the tools from both applied microeconomics and
climate science. 

Most recently, as part of the [NSF NRT Group at
UChicago](https://voices.uchicago.edu/nrtenergyandenvironment/), we have been
exploring winter-time weather variability trying to answer the question about
extreme weather events under climate change (i.e. are events like [this][2]
going to be more frequent in the future) and building metrics to capture and
measure its economic effects.
