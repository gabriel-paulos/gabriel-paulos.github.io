## about me 

{{< headshot src="/avatar3.png" name="" add="" >}}

I am a PhD candidate in the Earth System Science department at the [Stanford
Doerr School of Sustainability][5]. I am part of the [EchoLab][6] and lucky to
be advised by [Marshall Burke][7]. I am supported by a [Stanford Data Science
Fellowship][9] and the Ram and Vijay Shriram Sustainability Fellowship. In the
past, I was a pre-doctoral fellow at the Energy Policy Institute (EPIC) at the
University of Chicago, working at the [Climate Impact Lab][3]. In a previous
life, I was a Data Scientist at [DSaPP][4] (now @CMU), and a career bureaucrat
at the Central Bank of Colombia. 

## research interests

I evaluate the effects of environmental changes on humans. I also develop
machine learning models to create cool datasets that help us track humans and
nature in data-scarce scenarios. I am interested in downscaling climate data
products, multi-modal classification, measurement error in causal inference
models, and wildfires in the Western US.

## news and updates

  
  - **[11/23]** Me and my ~~weak~~ accepted paper on wildfire house' burning
    risk will be in the CompSust Workshop at NeurIPS 2023 in New Orleans. 
  - **[09/23]** I received the Stanford Data Science Fellowship (2 years) and
    now I am part of the SDS PhD Scholars ðŸ’»ðŸ¤–.
  - **[08/23]** I am presenting our work on wildfire house' burning risk using
    multimodal classification and recent developments in contrastive learning
    in [TWEEDS][8] in Portland.
