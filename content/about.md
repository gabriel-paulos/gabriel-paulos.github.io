## about me 

{{< headshot src="/avatar3.png" name="" add="" >}}

I am a PhD student in the Earth Systems Science department at the [Stanford
Doerr School of Sustainability][5] studying our changing environment. I am part
of the [EchoLab][6] advised by [Marshall Burke][7]. In the past, I was a
pre-doctoral fellow at the Energy Policy Institute (EPIC) at the University of
Chicago, working at the [Climate Impact Lab][3]. In a previous life, I was a
Data Scientist at [DSaPP][4] (now at CMU), and a career bureaucrat at the
Central Bank of Colombia. 

## research interests

I evaluate the effects of environmental changes on humans. I also develop
machine learning to create cool datasets that help us track humans and nature
in data-scarce scenarios. I am also curious about the atmospheric circulation
and weather/climate modeling, particularly how to downscale climate products
using physics-informed interpolations.
