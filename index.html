<p>I am a recent computer engineering graduate from the University of Toronto. Currently, 
	I am currently collaborating with Prof. Xujie Si on developing neuro-symbolic AI 
	systems to ground visual object motions to DSL programs.
</p>
<p>
My ultimate goal is to build socially-intelligent AI systems that are powerful, safe, 
and interpretable. Pursuing this goal requires interdisciplinary work that I hope to explore 
in the future, as it will require a blend of expertise in social sciences and in CS to accomplish this.
</p>
<p>
Previously, I have worked with Prof. Hans-Arno Jacobsen at the MSRG lab at UofT, where I worked 
on developing private distributed networks to examine the effects of transferring large data on 
the throughput and latency of resource constrained distributed network.

<h2 id="motivating-questions">motivating questions (WIP)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>What constitutes social intelligence for AI systems? How will this align with human values?</li>
	<li>How can we align machine and human representations of complex data across abstraction levels?</li>
	<li>How can we enable these systems to learn in highly dense modalities at varying levels of abstraction?</li>
	<li>What type of relationships should humans and their AI companions have with each other, and what should constitute 
	the limitiations of these relationships?</li>
	<li>How should we assess the safety risks of human-AI relationships?</li>
	<li>How can we assess the risks associated to powerful AI systems, that have access to real world tools and data?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="MCTS-DPO">MCTS DPO for VLMs</h4>

<p>VLMs are trained by using image-text pairs to map the image embedding space and the text embedding space into a 
joint embedding space. However there exists three problems with this approach: 
	
	<ul>
		<li>in comparsion to text, images are significantly denser modalities and hold much more noise</li>

		<li>there exists an imbalance between the importance of visual tokens and text tokens in VLMs,
		reducing how much attention visual tokens are given by VLMs </li>

		<li>these systems struggle with solving complex questions that require multiple steps</li>
	</ul>
	
Taking inspiration from the O1 model there is a requirement for building reasoning trees or graphs such that 
we could reach a final conclusion by exploring the space of possible explanations. However the added modality 
of vision makes this task more complex. In order to improve how we can reach a state of improving the "intuition" 
of these systems we will need a policy that is able to reward the system step-wise rather than conclusion-wise. 
This can be done using DPO.</p>

<h4 id="diversifying-captions">Generating more diverse and better quality captions</h4>

<p>
In order to improve datasets we need to be able to create systems that are able to reason about images over 
various abstraction levels. In order to do this we need to improve the development of our datasets. This 
involves creating systems that can automatically do this. 
</p>
<p>

Problem: VLMs struggle to connect an object with its parts. This makes creating detailed captions hard 
automatically. Potentially treating visual and text tokens as machine translation can potentially improve this 
by treating it as a translation problem whose objective is not necessarily the maximazation of hte log likelihood 
of the system, rather it should be able to look at the highest likelihoods and use that to create captions. The 
density of images renders the max log likelihood answer implicitly limited.
